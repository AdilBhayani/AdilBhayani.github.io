            <h1>Mark Yep</h1>
            <p>I am interested in web and software development opportunities, and I have a passion for computer systems engineering and microprocessor programming. I really enjoy developing web applications using dynamic API calls. This year I took part in the Summer of Tech Auckland Hackfest, in which my team of 5 created a web app which mapped nearby dining dining discounts and directions to them. I worked mainly on the front end using JavaScript, HTML5 and Less CSS.</p>

            <p>I study a conjoint Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science degree at the University of Auckland. I took on this degree because of my interest in all parts of computer systems â€“ especially the Internet of Things and low level computer architecture and design.</p>

            <p>Aside from being a regular computer enthusiast, I also enjoy exercise and sports. In previous years I have represented Auckland in badminton at both the junior and senior age groups. I still play socially at the university club on a weekly basis. In my spare time I like to follow the latest consumer PC component news, or play StarCraft II with friends.</p>

            <p>I have a strong work ethic and am extremely dedicated to any project that I work on. I dislike leaving work unfinished or not giving a task the entirety of my effort. At university I finished runner up in the optional extension of an assignment, worth no marks, which involved creating a card playing application to compete against other students.</p>

            <p>From computer science I have experience coding with Python and Java, and from computer systems engineering I have experience coding with C, C++, and MATLAB. For all these papers I have excelled on the practical side of the course more than the theoretical, as I thoroughly enjoy the processes of developing useful, real-world applications.</p>
